![Launch Spotify by URI](/images/screenshot-2020-10-17-061806.png "Logitech SetPoint")I have had the same Logitech K350 keyboards for some time, even though they were designed for use with Windows 8. The SetPoint software allows for customization of button mapping, but launching modern apps is occasionally difficult. To remedy this, it's easy to map the buttons to the [ms-settings URI](https://www.bing.com/search?q=ms-settings+URI+List) of each app.

```spotify:```
This also works nicely for built-in programs.
```ms-photos:```
